# Additional Bug Hunt Findings

This document lists potential issues discovered during a review of `IntelligentDataDetective_beta_v3.ipynb` that may cause errors when running the notebook in Google Colab.

## 1. Undefined variable `df_no_duplicates`
In the duplicate-removal tool, the DataFrame is updated using an undefined variable `df_no_duplicates` rather than the deduplicated `df` object. This will raise a `NameError` when executed.

```
  1888          df.drop_duplicates(keep='first', inplace=True)
  1890          rows_removed = original_row_count - len(df)
  1902          original_raw_path = global_df_registry.get_raw_path_from_id(df_id)
  1904          global_df_registry.register_dataframe(df_no_duplicates, df_id=df_id, raw_path=original_raw_path)
```

## 2. Duplicate Definitions of `perform_normality_test`
The function `perform_normality_test` is defined three separate times in cell 5. This redundant redefinition can lead to confusion and maintenance issues.

```
  2341  def perform_normality_test(df_id: str, column_name: str) -> str:
  ...
  2433  def perform_normality_test(df_id: str, column_name: str) -> str:
  ...
  2631  def perform_normality_test(df_id: str, column_name: str) -> str:
```

## 3. Python 3.11+ Type Hint Syntax
The supervisor node uses unpacking in `Literal[*options]` and `Literal[*members, "__end__"]`. This syntax requires Python 3.11 or newer and will raise a `SyntaxError` on Google Colab's default Python 3.10 runtime.

```
  3966      class Router(TypedDict):
  3968          next: Literal[*options]

  3972      def supervisor_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[*members, "__end__"]]:
```

## 4. Minor Issues Flagged by Pyflakes
Running `pyflakes` on the notebook's code reveals several unused imports, repeated function appends, and f-strings without placeholders. These won't necessarily break execution but add noise and potential confusion:

- Unused imports (`subprocess`, `io`, `InjectedToolArg`, etc.)
- Redefinition of `perform_normality_test` as mentioned above
- F-strings such as `f"Error: One or both columns not found."` without `{}` placeholders

## Summary
While most cells compile, the undefined variable and the Python version incompatibility in the supervisor node are the most critical issues likely to cause runtime errors in Google Colab. The other findings are minor but worth addressing to improve code clarity.
