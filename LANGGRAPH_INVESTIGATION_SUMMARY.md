## Technical Implementation Details

### Supervisor Node Logic
```python
# Core supervisor processing pattern
def supervisor_node(state: State):
    1. Increment _count_ (step tracking)
    2. Analyze current state and completion flags
    3. Search memory for relevant context
    4. Determine next agent via routing LLM
    5. Update plan and progress tracking
    6. Generate instructions for next agent
    7. Return routing command with context
```

### Agent Node Pattern
```python
# Standard agent execution pattern
def agent_node(state: State):
    1. Extract context from state
    2. Retrieve relevant memories
    3. Prepare prompt with tools and data
    4. Execute agent with LLM
    5. Validate structured output
    6. Update state with results and completion flag
    7. Return state updates
```

### Fan-out/Fan-in Implementation
```python
# Orchestrator dispatches parallel work
def orchestrator(state: State):
    return [Send("worker", {"task": task}) for task in tasks]

# Workers process individual tasks
def worker(state: State):
    result = process_task(state["task"])
    return {"results": [result]}  # Appended via operator.add

# Join aggregates all results
def join_node(state: State):
    all_results = state["results"]
    return {"final_output": aggregate(all_results)}
```

## Context and Variable Tracking
